                <h3>Raju Narisetti</h3>
        <h4>Cheif Executive Officer of Gizmodo Media Group</h4>
            
<p>In 2018, digital news companies will get bought and sold, big-name brands will miss their ambitious growth goals, while plenty of newsrooms will keep pirouetting amid more jobs cut. And many news executives, mostly white men, will keep getting hired in big jobs. <img src="../images/raju-narisetti.jpg" alt="rajunarisetti" style=""/>

<p>In much of the journalism we will read about these inevitable changes in 2018, much like we read in 2017, most media writers will express surprise, shock, exuberance, and angst, with criticism of owners, executives, platforms, investors, and business models.
   
<p>In other words, the 2018 media coverage will read like déjà vu all over again.

<p>So here are some suggestions — to ourselves as fans and well-wishers of our industry — on how what we might want to better cover what are likely to be some key topics of discussion within our industry in 2018.

<p>As a reporter, editor, and now the steward and custodian of a wide range of journalism as well as journalists’ jobs at the Fusion Media Group, I am both guilty as charged, and the occasional beneficiary of how we mostly cover our industry. Being critical of how we do what we do isn’t about being negative or being down on this half-full digital sustainability glass — it is about acknowledging being critical is key to getting better. And we all need to do better, if for no other reason than for the sake of not surprising our readers in 2018, all over again.

<p><b>Our Talmudic path to profitability</b>
    
<p>If that red-hot media company you are profiling is a public company that has to report its results to the SEC, or you happen to have their actual audited P&L in front of you, don’t simply quote media CEOs or investors saying they are “profitable” this year or will “break even” within a couple of quarters. Unless, that is, you are a believer in Enron-accounting.

<p>Profits as defined by private businesses, or those owned by private equity, assorted billionaires and media executives, or by larger companies — even when they are public — is an utterly meaningless word, because there is no single accepted definition of that kind of profitability. Eventually some of us will have to be genuinely profitable — or we won’t be around, but for now, it will be a Talmudic roadmap with lots of twists and turns before getting to our respective destinations at different speeds.

<p>So start by asking a lot more specific questions, along with wanting supporting data, with “we don’t disclose numbers” being your first clue to not waste your readers’ time in simply repeating profitability claims. At least, not without clearly telling us these are unverifiable claims with the media executives having refused to offer supporting evidence.

<p>And the next time you are being told about yet another round of fundraising, whatever the increased on-paper valuation the company now claims, ask yourself, before you hype that news:

<p><i>Why is putting additional money into a business that is clearly spending more than it is making, a sign of success? It’s called “burn” rate for a reason.</i>

<p><b>Matters of size</b>

<p>Start by telling your readers that you are writing about an industry that mostly relies on terribly inadequate third-parties for almost all its audience data.

<p>The biggest data providers, be it Nielsen (which recently fessed up to failing to capture live streaming audiences) or comScore (with small, problematic sample sizes, especially for non-U.S. audiences) or Quantcast (why would you rely on what is primarily an advertising data company for newsroom insights?) or Google Analytics (your reader data is courtesy Google, really?) often leave gaping holes in fully understanding how a media company is faring. And journalists simply citing these slivers of data will only allow media executives to easily talk their way out of any publicly available bad news data trends. (Notice how these same companies never complain about that very dataset when everything is not pointing south?)

<p>To be sure, all media companies are stuck with using these third parties because we never bothered to invest a lot in data capabilities, but also because the ad industry has to rely on some public common-denominator data it can (barely, it turns out) trust. But we can at least be a bit more skeptical on behalf of our readers in citing these numbers.

<p>As for surveys and data from the likes of Chartbeat, Parse.ly, and myriad others who make a good living off newsroom dashboards and analytics, please caveat our temptation to use and extrapolate from their data in drawing those sweeping conclusions about the state of a company or the industry. That’s because, by nature, these are self-serving surveys for the narrow data-business models of these companies vying for more media clients, by claiming to have new-new ways to help clients monetize their audience data.

<p><i>When is the last time we actually asked a media company to talk about what percentage of their monthly unique visitors or visits come from social media platforms? The answer to that might tell how “not in control” any one of us is, of our own business model.</i>

<p><b>E-commerce</b>

<p>Yep, everyone is talking it up and planning to sell truck-loads of stuff to their audiences. So here are basic questions we might consider asking the next time some media company talks up its big push into e-commerce.

<p>For starters, what exactly do we mean by e-commerce? Is it starting an affiliate business with links to Amazon and Jet and eBay? If so, there’s absolutely nothing unique or new about it, so what is different about this particular e-commerce push? Is the company getting into handling actual products, by itself? If so, ask a lot of questions about inventory management, returns policy, write-off risks, merchandizing expertise (very little exists in most media companies, by the way), relevant new staffing needs, and why, when Amazon is crushing every retailer out there, this media company thinks it can make a typically low-margin, inventory-centric business work.

<p>Oh, they are outsourcing all of that to third parties, are they? Guess what — those slim product-commerce margins just got even thinner. Also feel free to dig deep into the connection between how they are mapping their journalism — presumably the reason why they have audiences — to specific products. If you hear they plan to sell a lot of candles on a listicles site, pause and ask yourself if that makes any sense for a millennial to buy from that news brand. Sticking big “Buy” buttons on every page is not a strategy — actually it might just take away a potential guaranteed revenue spot (even if very low programmatic dollars) away for that media company.

<p><i>Ask what is the conversion rate assumption on their e-commerce business. See if they can easily define “conversion.” And then, if you hear anything more than, say, 4 percent conversion, ask a lot more questions about why that number will be higher for them, than what is the industry average at media companies that have been doing it for a few years.</i>

<p><b>The subscriptions syndrome</b>

<p>Repeat after me: Not all subscribers are equal.

<p>A lot of media companies have gained a lot of paying subscribers this past year, and the headline numbers are indeed impressive. For starters, the next time a media company gives you a quarterly update on subscribers, please separate print and digital subscribers. Then start asking some hard questions about where the subscriptions are coming from (near-free offers for a bunch of months via Amazon Prime, for example), and what the average revenue per new subscriber, is at that company.

<p>No media company will volunteer to tell you the cost of acquiring subscribers (it’s a lot of upfront investment, by the way), so at least ask for that, since new subscribers are not profitable unless they keep renewing their subscription for a few years. Which also means that we all need to come up to speed on questions about lifetime value, yields, and retention rates. And don’t forget to ask how much of reader revenue came from increasing rates during the period, since rising rates often can work against subscriber retention, usually a year down the line.

<p><i>We read a lot about the great subscription upside of the “Trump Bump” in 2017. Now is the time to start asking about churn, please. Because pouring more into leaking buckets won’t solve the existential business model challenges of any media company, however wishful our politics might want that to be.</i>

<p><b>On being a member</b>

<p>As reader revenue becomes more front and center, there is going to be a lot of talk about memberships. Many public broadcasting outlets have been at it for a while now. Many other media companies are just starting out so there will be a lot of executives spinning up tales about this.

<p>For starters, separate one-time donations and pleas for contributions, however well meaning they might sound, from memberships. A free tote bag for getting your credit card dinged each year doesn’t automatically a member make. It is welcome charitable behavior and often works well when a larger notion of public good is in the mix.

<p>Brands such as The Wall Street Journal, with its WSJ+ membership model, have natural advantages because they can leverage parent News Corp’s expanded network, be it offering HarperCollins hardcover books or access to National Geographic explorer events. Throw in in-person invites to Journal journalism events or newsroom tours, which create scarcity out of things that really aren’t, and you have the makings of truly unique membership perks. This means the annual conversation around renewing my Journal subscription is no longer about just paying for journalism but a bundle of unique offerings, available only to WSJ+ members, which just happens to also include free access to the Journal.

<p>So if memberships are to really work and...</p>
