      <p> Four years ago, @runixo made an interactive world map that showed how a few thousand of security cameras connected to the internet were broadcasting live through the networks without the owners knowing. We put on the front page of a newspaper, Página/12, and the blowback lived for exactly one morning. Then suddenly, a few days later and without any promotion, the map got more than 500,000 visits, their origins unclear to us. Someone at The Verge had found the “creepy horror” map. With the traffic still exploding, Google Maps sent us a message saying that it was “very nice” what we had done but we were violating Google Maps privacy policies. And so we were deactivated. The users had started playing with the map to discover naked people in the cameras. </p>

<p>At that moment, we understood the power of stories turned into interactive games. Telling news through games isn’t just a playful way of informing readers — it’s also a way to create added value for publishers.
Game developers have a lot to contribute. In Latin America, a number of disruptive games have appeared that show social problems through the aesthetics of Mortal Kombat: a thief robbing passengers on a subway, for example, with the victims looking for police to help. It’s not a photo or an interactive — it’s a game about a social problem that is also giving information about what happens daily in the subways of Buenos Aires. Another trash genre is the shitty games, games that tell news created in two or three days by a handful of audiovisual producers. With Mario Brothers aesthetics, they tell of escapes from prison, car crashes, inflation, and more, turning issues into something relevant in time and form.
We see plenty of experiments. The New York Times dialect quiz that was among the paper’s top three articles in traffic for two consecutive years. The 3-D line that illustrates the financial bubble in The Wall Street Journal. The how-to-be-an-Uber-driver game from the Financial Times. They show that stories turned into games aren’t only surprising and disruptive, but they can also makes sense from the point of view of business models. And they’re becoming easier to do. A couple of weeks ago, we were inspired by the You Draw It interactives of The New York Times to draw a parallel between the governments of former Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and Mauricio Macri. The game generated an impact on traffic and increased new registered users.</p>
                 
                
<p>News games are difficult to copy, scalable, and increase the value proposition of media companies. News games can become the news themself and generate the viral audience that generate increases direct and social traffic. However, they are expensive to build, and turning them into a regular part of the journalistic workflow is a complicated task. Newsrooms are fast; software development is (often) slow. Most CMSes are designed for simple content; performance can be an issue, and making sure they translate into AMP or Instant Articles can be an uphill battle. The combination of facilities to create environments of virtual reality and the speed of a generation of stories based on games opens a path not yet fully developed for the world of news. The challenge will be to move from experimentation to a business model, and to systematic investment in the team and workflows necessary. By the way, Insecam, a new site, is once again showing all the Internet-connected cameras broadcasting live without their owners knowing. It’s a game being taken to another level.</p>
